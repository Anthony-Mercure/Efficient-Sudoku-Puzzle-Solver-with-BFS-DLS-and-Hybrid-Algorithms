Summary of solvePuzzleHybrid():
The hybrid solver integrates a heuristic to rank the most constrained cells (cells with the most limited choices for
valid numbers in the puzzle) and combines the depth-focused approach of Depth-Limited Search (DLS) with the broad state
exploration of Breadth-First Search (BFS). The solver limits its search to the most impactful moves by concentrating on
cells with fewer viable possibilities, preventing pointless memory use and repeated searches. By using Iterative
Deepening A* (IDA*) to adjust its depth, this technique strikes a balance between the depth-limiting characteristics of
DFS and the memory-intensive nature of BFS. Because it concentrates on cells with fewer possibilities, the hybrid solver
does well on most puzzles, particularly those with a higher degree of constraint. However, the heuristic might not be as
successful in reducing the search space in highly symmetrical or minimally constrained puzzles, so in these instances it
will be slower than usual.
Because the hybrid solver constantly refines the search depending on the heuristic, it is faster than BFS, particularly
when puzzles are more constrained. Nevertheless, the hybrid solution could be slower than DFS and need more iterations
if the heuristic does not significantly guide the search. In such cases, the algorithm essentially performs the same
operations as DFS but with additional overhead from heuristic calculations and iterative threshold adjustments. Because
the hybrid solution avoids storing every conceivable state at once, space efficiency is improved compared to BFS. Unlike
BFS, which may become unreasonably costly in terms of space (demonstrated by HardPuzzle2.txt), the hybrid solver
balances memory consumption by employing heuristic-based exploration and dynamic depth limitation.
The hybrid solver is more appropriate for rapidly identifying a single solution as opposed to identifying all possible
solutions. Finding the first possible solution is its main priority, and it stops when it does. With some adjustments,
it could be able to identify all solutions, but it is not built with this function in mind. The heuristic and the
iterative deepening process, which are key components of the algorithm's efficiency, work well for solving constrained
puzzles but may not be as good at exploring every possibility in puzzles that call for an exhaustive search. The hybrid
solver's dependence on heuristic prioritizing speeds it up in some situations but restricts its ability to do an
exhaustive search.
